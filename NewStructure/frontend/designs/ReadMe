Summary:
This project is using Node.js + Express for the backend. All backend/server files are located in the server directory.
The frontend uses Vite.js with a React template, which is a more modern way to create React projects. Everything for
our frontend is in the "frontend" directory. Within "frontend/src" we have two main directories. "Components" contains
everything that will be universal throughout every webpage, such as the header, navbar, and footer. "pages" contains all
of the jsx and css for any webpage we have made. within this src directory without being in another directory is
App.jsx which lays universal rules (such as light mode, font, etc.) and main.jsx which is the root file of hte front end.
this is where all of our files are "connected." index.html is the only html file we have to set the default language,
character set, title of the webpage, and favicon. The "public" directory contains all images we might use, such as
the UTampa logo.

Note for the project:
There are three branches, a main branch which is pretty simple, our final product will be on this branch. there is a
'frontend' and 'backend' branch as well, which is where each team respectively works within.

Naming scheme:
All frontend file names use the same naming scheme. App, index, and main are all standard/good practice names which were
default created for us by creating a react project. All web pages have (in lower case) the name of the page followed by
"Page."  "loginPage.jsx" is an example of our naming scheme. All jsx files are styled with a file of the same name but
with a ".css" file extension to show it's the style sheet for that page. In the discord server, we have a "variable-names"
chat which no one can speak in unless it's giving a variable that was created. This is to keep consistency and make sure
frontend and backend are using the same variable names and keep communication errors to a minimum.
